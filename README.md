# OmicsDataAugmentationAlzheimerDL
This project focuses on the use of advanced data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of classification models applied to neurological diseases. The research compares the efficacy of two data augmentation methods, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Majority Weighted Oversampling (MWO), across various classification algorithms, including SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, using datasets with different numbers of biomarkers.

## Datasets
The dataset used in this project is GSE46579: A blood-based 12-miRNA signature of Alzheimer patients.
